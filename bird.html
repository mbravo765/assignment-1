      With over 10,906 bird species in the world, birds live in almost every kind of habitat known to humans. They reside in tropical forests, urban cities, and even in cold climates.
      The gentic line of birds traces to over 66 million years ago. Birds are best known for their ability to fly with their lightweight skeletons. Birds also allow scientists to trace a common ancestor between dinosaurs and birds.
      Despite their long success in the evolution area, thousands of birds are at risk of becoming instinct because of human consumption around them. The habitats of birds is threatened daily and the addition of climate change has already put some species at risk.
