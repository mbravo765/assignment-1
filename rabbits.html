      Domesticated rabbits can be classified into 305 breeds. There are also wild species that have adapted to survive in the woods.
      Rabbits are at the bottom of the food chain so they adapted to have large ears to be able to locate potential predators. 
      Sometime around the Middle Ages, humans began breeding rabbits for livestock and fur. Rabbits are herbivores and are able to survive on grass. In the last decade, rabbits began to be kept as pets. However, it is dangerous to raise a wild rabbit as a pet because wild rabbits have adapted to have different diets.
