      Deers reside in most of North America, hiding in forests, and they also reside in every other continent besides Antartica and Australia.
      Deer are mammals who prefer grasslands or mountains. Deer are know to have large antlers and long legs. 
      In some parts of the United States, deer are still hunted for their meat. Deer also pose a great health risk to develop deadly diseases such as chronic wasting disease.
