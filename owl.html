      Owls are a special kind of bird species because they are nocturnal predators. Owls have larger bodies and hawk-like beaks to make it easier 
      to take their prey. Owls are known to hunt small rodents and sometimes fish.
      In some areas with human population, owls can be known to attack humans if they percieve them as a threat.
      Owls have serrated edges on their talons making them deadly predators with the capacity to cause serious head injuries to humans.
